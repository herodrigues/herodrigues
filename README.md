# Hey, I'm Herinson 👋

I'm a developer who loves to contribute to open-source projects and bring more people into the programming world. Currently living in Brazil and working from home, my main projects are modern web applications (React/Vue/CSS/HTML/JS) and creation of dynamic and static PDFs (XML/XDP/JavaScript).<br>
I'm also a member of [rcsoccersim](https://github.com/rcsoccersim/), an organization maintained by the RoboCup Soccer Simulation commitee. 

My other interests are data visualization, mathematics and music production! 

I'm usually on the web as **herodrigues**.<br>
It stands for _he + rodrigues_ or _herinson + rodrigues_ or a bad pun with the word _hero_ + _rodrigues_.
